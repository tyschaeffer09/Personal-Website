			<h1 id="bio1">Biography</h1>
			<p>As I said, my name is Ty Schaeffer, and I am an Applied Software Engineering major here at NKU. 
			Before coming to NKU, I attended Bishop Brossart for all four years of my highschool career. 
			During that time I played soccer for the school and for a seperate club team. 
			My senior year of high school I was given the All-State award for defenders in soccer, and ranked #2 in Northern Kentucky for defenders.
			I have been working at Town and Country in Wilder, Ky, since I was a freshman at Bishop Brossart and I am still working there to this day.
			I have and still work as a concession stand worker and at the front desk. 
			I am still unsure of my minor, but am thinking about Japanese, so i can hopefully study abroad in Japan my junior year.
